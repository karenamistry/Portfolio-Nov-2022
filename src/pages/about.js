                Hi! I'm Karena. I studied design at York University. I've worked
                in graphic design for the past 5 years, but recently specialized
                myself in product design. Product design is what i've always had
                a passion for but I wasn't able to find my footing in it until
                recently. I've worked on applications that are being used in
                Canadian Tire Stores, signage for successful political campaigns
                and designed for startups in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal.

                Just some fun things about myself. I enjoy music in a variety of
                languages, like spanish and french. I also enjoy reading about
                design and coding in my free time! (I coded this site ðŸ¤“)
