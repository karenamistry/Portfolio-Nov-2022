              <div className="h4">
                I studied design in the York University/Sheridan College Joint
                program. Recently I've specialized myself in product design but
                i've been interested in interface and experience since I was
                twelve, recreating websites pixel for pixel in Adobe Photoshop
                (version 4.0).
              </div>
              <div className="h4">
                I have a experience working in a variety of design fields like
                print, digital content & ui/ux design. I've worked on
                applications that are being used in Canadian Tire Stores,
                signage for successful political campaigns and designed for
                startups in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal.

                I'm kind of a nerd. I love Marvel movies, playing video games
                and reading fantasy. I love learning about front end development
                in my free time (I coded this site ü§ì). I love learning, so I
                also have been reading a lot of about designing experiences and
                product strategy.
