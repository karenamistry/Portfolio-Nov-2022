            I studied design in the York University/Sheridan College Joint
            program. Recently I've specialized myself in product design but i've
            been interested in interface and experience since I was twelve,
            recreating websites pixel for pixel in Adobe Photoshop (version
            4.0).

            I have a experience working in a variety of design fields like
            print, digital content & ui/ux design. I've worked on applications
            that are being used in Canadian Tire Stores, signage for successful
            political campaigns and designed for startups in Ottawa, Toronto and
            Montreal.

            I'm kind of a nerd. I love Marvel movies, playing video games and
            reading fantasy. I love learning about front end development in my
            free time (I coded this site ü§ì). Lately, I've been reading a lot of
            about designing experience and product strategy.
