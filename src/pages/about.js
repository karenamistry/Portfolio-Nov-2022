            üë©‚Äçüíª Hello! I'm Karena. I'm currently a product designer for Dyanmic
            CXS, I've previously designed for multiple startups across Canada.

          <div className="h3">
            I studied design at York University/Sheridan College, Joint program.
            I have 5 years experience outside of product design, working in a
            variety of fields like print, social media content & visual design.
            I've worked on applications that are being used in Canadian Tire
            Stores, signage for successful political campaigns and designed for
            startups in Ottawa, Toronto and Montreal.

          <div className="h3">
            Recently I've specialized myself in product design but i've been
            interested in interface and experience since I was twelve,
            recreating websites pixel for pixel in Adobe Photoshop, version 4.0.

            I'm kind of a nerd. I love Marvel movies, playing video games and
            reading fantasy. I love learning about front end development in my
            free time (I coded this site ü§ì). Lately, i've been learning how to
            build mechanical keyboards.
