            Hello! I'm Karena. I'm currently a product designer for Dyanmic CXS,
            I've previously designed for multiple startups in Canada.

            I studied design at York University/Sheridan College, Joint program.
            I'm a very versatile designer with experience in print and
            publishing, social media strategy, and UI/UX design. I believe in
            the importance of data-driven design, and iâ€™ve learned to present
            those ideas well after having worked with small teams, sometimes as
            the only design voice.

            I'm kind of a nerd. I love Marvel movies, playing video games and
            reading fantasy. I love learning about front end development in my
            free time (I coded this site). Lately, i've been learning how to
            build mechanical keyboards.
