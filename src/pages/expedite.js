                Expedite organizes the complex systems behind the
                pickup-in-store process. The mobile application manages the
                communication between customer facing and warehouse employees in
                retail stores at each step in the process.

                A goal we had was to add new features to the expedite flow,
                specifically the customer profile. The customer profile was made
                to vastly improve customer satisfaction during the customer
                journey. The customer profile needed to be integrated with the
                already complex CXP user journey for customer facing employees.

                Another goal while working on Expedite was readying the product
                for soft launch. This meant that speed was the name of the game.
                For this reason, we needed a design system to aid in the
                consistency and speed for designing and developing pages.

                Building type styles to be used across all the expedite
                application was a design challenge I faced. The amount of
                information needed to pack into the small components made the
                texts styles more extensive, and required more attention to
                hierarchy.

                The main purpose of the design system, in the case of expedite,
                was to create consistency across multiple applications. Working
                with already existing brand colors, I was able to build a
                solidified and documented design system.
