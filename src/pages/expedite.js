                  Logistics employees (Warehouse), Cash (Checkout) & Statistics.

                  The main purpose of the design system in the case of expedite
                  was to create consistency across multiple applications.
                  Working with already existing brand colors, I was able to
                  build a solidified and documented design system of colours,
                  components and typography.

                  There are 9 different type styles being used in the current
                  application. My main concern when designing the typography was
                  accommodating employees with poorer eyesight. The type system
                  is complex because it needed to be very versatile. Having a
                  large variety of sizes allowed for more flexibility when
                  designing highly condensed information based components.
                  Hierarchy also needed to be tight, so that information is
                  easily accessible at a glance.

                  In order to speed up the process of obtaining customer contact
                  information, the customer profile was made so basic customers
                  contact information is already in the system. The customer
                  profile needed to be integrated with the already existing
                  expedite user journey, for picking, used by customer facing
                  employees. This was a challenge to integrate in a clean way,

                  We learned that employees were often picking items in similar
                  departments all at once. This meant that there needed to be an
                  option to select a single or multiple items during the picking
                  and loading stages. To solve for this we adjusted the
                  interface to allow for multiple items to be picked.

                  When developing our customer profile, we were running into the
                  problem of having multiple accounts in the system under the
                  same phone number. To solve this problem, the customer profile
                  is created when a phone number is not found in the Expedite
                  system. Employees are prompted to create a new profile using
                  that number.

                  Originally, I had designed a multiple dash interface element
                  to help employees keep track of where they were in the
                  process. We later learned that this was confusing users,
                  because users each counted the steps differently. This was
                  replaced with a timeline element that just reached closer to
                  completion at the end of each step.
