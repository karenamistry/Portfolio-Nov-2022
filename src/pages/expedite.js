            Expedite was created was to streamline the complex systems behind
            the pickup-in-store process of warehouse products. The improvement

            pickup order has made for higher customer satisfaction. It is

            Customer facing/experience employees c) Logistics/Warehouse
            employees d) Cash employees d) Statistics. The categories helped me
            better manage my questions.

            I decided to conduct a PACT analysis because there are a lot of

            users need to touch the mobile application in order to complete a
            customer pickup, so understanding the user is imperative to
            completing the products intended tasks.

            Expedite is an interesting product to work on because it takes into
            account the journey that both the employee and the customer take.
            This was very difficult for me to understand at first, so creating
            user journeys introduced a lot more clarity all around.

          <div className="h3">
            We conducted user testing with Canadian Tire employees in different
            roles to get an idea of how well the prototype was working during
            each stage of the Expedite process. User testing was hard to
            schedule, so we conducted short 10 minute testing scenarios where we
            asked employees to try and complete a task and express any of their
            pain points to us. We also observed any trouble they were having.
          </div>
          <div className="h3">
            We learned that employees were very often picking items in similar
            departments all at once. This meant that there needed to be an
            option to select a single or multiple items during the picking and
            loading stages. To solve for this we adjusted the interface to allow
            for multiple items to be picked.
          </div>
          <div className="h3">
            When developing our customer profile, we were running into the
            problem of having multiple accounts in the system under the same
            phone number. To solve this problem, the customer profile is created
            when a phone number is not found in the Expedite system. Employees
            are prompted to create a new profile using that number.
          </div>
          <div className="h3">
            Originally, I had designed a multiple dash interface element to help
            employees keep track of where they were in the process. We later
            learned that this was confusing users, because users each counted
            the steps differently. This was replaced with a timeline element
            that reached closer to completion at the end of each step.

          <div className="h2">The Visual System</div>
          <div className="h3">
            A purpose for the Expedite design system was to create consistency
            across multiple applications. Working with already existing brand
            colours, I was able to build a solidified and documented design
            system of colours, components and typography. The system made it
            easier for the development team to publish designs, allowing for
            user testing to be done more often with Canadian Tire employees,
            giving us more consistent feedback.

          <div className="h2">Creating Accessible Designs</div>
          <div className="h3">
            We had a very heterogeneous user base that could vary in
            technological ability. My main concern when designing the typography
            was accommodating employees with poorer eyesight. The colours
            created had a high enough contrast ratio to be accessible for all
            employees. For this reason, there are 9 different type styles being
            used in the current application. Having a large variety of sizes
            allowed for more flexibility when designing highly condensed
            information based components.
