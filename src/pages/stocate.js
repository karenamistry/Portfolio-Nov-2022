                Using a backlog of user data obtained from prior user testing

                user comments from separate users concerning the initial
                versions of the Stocate mobile and web applications. We were
                looking to parse the most crucial problems users were having in

                could work on the solution. This was initially done in an excel
                document to test the benefits of this organization. We intended
                to develop a dashboard system to organize incoming feedback in
                realtime. I designed a interface solution based on the
                organizational structure of the excel document. This dashboard
                is in the development stage.

                provided us with a) user's thoughts concerning the core use
                cases for the application, because we were still in the process
                of solidifying our primary product goal. b) Their general
                thoughts on the interface likes and dislikes. Interviews did not
                reach the specificity of user testing. c) As well as features
                they would like to see in the application. Interviews provided
                information to narrow down our personas, core problems and get
                us in contact with potential users.

                With the customer at the core of our design philosophy, the
                process of arriving at a final design solution was very
                iterative. The process we used for creating design solutions was
                the Agile sprint methodology, with our sprints lasting around 1
                to 2 weeks each. Our goal from the sprints was to improve the
                core features of our applications, in order to retain active
                users.

                Our team worked to make user flow diagrams for the entire
                application, because that documentation was not yet in place. We
                diagrammed the user flows in figma, so we could visualize the
                prototype more clearly, in our mobile application. Before
                starting the design process, mapping user flows helped us figure
                out where improvements could be made.

                Our MVP already existed, my job was to bring the MVP to a more
                definite and concise model. During this stage in the process, I
                was able to iterate upon our design system. The design system
                was not yet built during the beginning of my internship, so I
                created components as they were needed. I later created a more
                concise and documented design system to improve the speed of
                creating mid and high fidelity mockups and prototypes.

                User testing was conducted to improve clarity, speed and
                enjoyment for users within specific user flows. User testing was
                conducted for each sprint during the mid fidelity stage. Once
                users provided us with their feedback, we moved to the high
                fidelity stage, where all flaws and details were ironed out.

              <div className="paragraph ">
                I conducted user testing bi-weekly with different users, during
                sprints for our mobile application. User testing sessions were a
                mix of in-person and via Zoom. They each lasted about 30 mins.
                The first section of the session would be an interview with the
                user, to help build our personas and understand user
                perspectives. In the second section, users would walk me through
                their experience with our Figma prototype. During this portion,
                I am able to focus in on roadblocks users have during specific
                areas of the application.

              <div className="paragraph ">
                Improved user journeys within the application were created by
                conducting extensive user testing and iterating afterwards.
                After user testing a user flow or a feature, I would return to
                prototyping in Figma to resolve problems or challenges users had
                brought up. For most features, iterating once or twice was
                enough, but larger user flows required three or four iterations.
                This was the case when designing for the adding flows because it
                was a more complex problem to solve for.

                To meet our mission of creating customer centered design
                solutions, we needed to receive and respond to customer needs
                within the applications as quickly as we can. One of the systems
                I built to aid in this process was the design system. It was
                built to aid in the speed of designing and implementing for
                pages within the mobile and desktop applications. The process of
                building the system was very iterative because the system was
                constantly growing.

              <div className="paragraph ">
                Before I started my internship, a style guide was created to lay
                the groundwork for the design system that I built. The
                groundwork consisted of the primary teal, that was used in the
                logo, and a few typographic styles that were not yet documented.

                Another one of the systems I helped build to aid in process of
                creating customer centered design solutions was the feedback
                dashboard. The feedback dashboard is an end-to-end process for
                receiving customer problems and creating user centered
                solutions. It was created to organize the excess of customer
                feedback received directly from the application and feedback
                received from user testing. It allowed us to prioritize feedback
                on a scale of 1-5, as well as group similar feedbacks.

                Working at Stocate was like when they say to always work with
                people smarter than yourself. It paid off in the amount of
                growth i've had as a designer and as a member of a product team.
                Working closely with a development team made the importance of
                communication that much more crucial. I was able to hone my
                skills in planning and presenting ideas to stakeholders. Getting
                experience creating human centered design solutions helped me
                better understand how to juggle user wants versus needs.
