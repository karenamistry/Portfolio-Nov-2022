                  goals through the product and development teams. My primary
                  goal was to increase the amount of active users we retained in
                  the application. My secondary goal was to speed up our process
                  of implementing new design solutions into our MVP. These goals
                  were actualized through the completion of the following
                  solutions and systems I built during my internship.

                  Generating design solutions for user problems within the
                  mobile application was one of my main tasks at Stocate. We
                  wanted to strengthen our core features, in order to improve
                  our active user numbers and solidify our core user journey. To
                  improve a core feature, I went through steps of conducting
                  user research, designing, user testing & iterating.

                  Learning about the user is integral to my design process. I
                  conducted a variety of user interviews to get information
                  about our primary and secondary user personas. These
                  interviews provided us with a) user's thoughts concerning the
                  core use cases for the application, because we were still in
                  the process of solidifying our primary product goal. b) Their
                  general thoughts on the interface likes and dislikes.
                  Interviews did not reach the specificity of user testing. c)
                  Features they would like to see in the application. Interviews
                  provided information to narrow down our personas, core
                  problems and get us in contact with potential users.

                  Using a backlog of user data obtained from prior user testing
                  and in-app feedback, I was able to organize and sort of over
                  180 user comments from separate users concerning the initial
                  versions of the Stocate mobile and web applications. We were
                  looking to parse the most crucial problems users were having
                  in our applications, so we could prioritize them when building
                  solutions.

                <div className="h4 max-w-xl">
                  I organized all the data by type of problem, section of the
                  app it concerned, completion status of of that feedback, &
                  team that could work on the solution. This was initially done
                  in an excel document to test the benefits of this
                  organization. We intended to develop a dashboard system to
                  organize incoming feedback in realtime. I designed a interface
                  solution based on the organizational structure of the excel
                  document. This dashboard is in the development stage.

                  Once we understood user feedback, we were able to prioritize
                  solving for crucial interface and experience flaws in the
                  design of the desktop and mobile application. We brainstormed
                  and discussed potential solution routes about how we might go
                  about solving for these core problems. We were able to narrow
                  our core problems to specific users flows in the application
                  that needed improvement.The mobile application was where we
                  started this development. The user flows we planned sprints
                  for were: Onboarding, Adding, Messaging, & Transactions.

                  With the customer at the core of our design philosophy, the
                  process of arriving at a final design solution was very
                  iterative. The process we used for creating design solutions
                  was the Agile sprint methodology, with our sprints lasting
                  around 1 to 2 weeks each. Our goal from the sprints was to
                  improve the core features of our applications, in order to
                  retain active users.

                  Our team worked to make user flow diagrams for the entire

                  We diagrammed the user flows in figma, so we could visualize
                  the prototype more clearly, in our mobile application. Before
                  starting the design process, mapping user flows helped us

                  To meet our mission of creating customer centered design
                  solutions, we needed to receive and respond to customer needs
                  within the applications as quickly as we can. One of the
                  systems I built to aid in this process was the design system.
                  It was built to aid in the speed of designing and implementing
                  for pages within the mobile and desktop applications. The
                  process of building the system was very iterative because the
                  system was constantly growing.

                  Before I started my internship, a style guide was created to
                  lay the groundwork for the design system that I built. The
                  groundwork consisted of the primary teal, that was used in the
                  logo, and a few typographic styles that were not yet

                  receiving customer problems and creating user centered
                  solutions. It was created to organize the excess of customer

                  received from user testing. It allowed us to prioritize

                  Our MVP already existed, my job was to bring the MVP to a more
                  definite and concise model. During this stage in the process,
                  I was able to iterate upon our design system. I created
                  components as they were needed. This kept our design system
                  smaller and more intentional. The mockups I created worked off
                  the design of our prior application.

                  User testing was conducted to improve clarity, speed and
                  enjoyment for users within specific user flows. User testing
                  was conducted for each sprint during the mid fidelity stage.
                  Once users provided us with their feedback, we moved to the
                  high fidelity stage, where all flaws and details were ironed
                  out.

                  I conducted user testing bi-weekly with different users,
                  during sprints for our mobile application. User testing
                  sessions were a mix of in-person and via Zoom. They each
                  lasted about 30 mins. The first section of the session would
                  be an interview with the user, to help build our personas and
                  understand user perspectives. In the second section, users
                  would walk me through their experience with our Figma
                  prototype. During this portion, I am able to focus in on
                  roadblocks users have during specific areas of the
                  application. Conducting interviews and completing scenarios in
                  the application provided us with both quantitative and
                  qualitative information.

                  Improved user journeys within the application were created by
                  conducting extensive user testing and iterating afterwards.
                  After user testing, I would return to prototyping in Figma to
                  resolve problems or challenges users had brought up. For most
                  features, iterating once or twice was enough time spent, but
                  larger user flows required three or four iterations. This was
                  the case when designing for the adding flows because it was a
                  more complex problem to solve for.

                  growth i've had as a designer and as a member of a product
                  team. Working closely with a development team made the
                  importance of communication that much more crucial. I was able
                  to hone my skills in planning and presenting ideas to
                  stakeholders. Getting experience creating human centered
                  design solutions helped me better understand how to juggle
                  user wants versus needs.
