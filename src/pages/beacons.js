                Beacons is an "ask for help" button for retail stores that is
                managed through a mobile application. This project started as a
                case study, but I worked with Dynamics CXS to bring these
                solutions to development. I redesigned their previous interface
                to improve user journeys, adjust for accessibility and build a
                design system.

                  Beacons was created with the goal of enhancing the customer to

                  by creating a design that was more clearly emphasizes employee
                  success, over retailer success alone.

                  I started researching by interviewing employees at the
                  Canadian Tire Kanata store to learn the application from their
                  perspective. I did this to learn about pain points within the
                  user journeys. Some questions I asked were as such: What do
                  you consider pros and cons? What was the previous system used
                  to answer customer requests? Can you walk me through your
                  regular use cases of the app?

                <div className="h4 max-w-xl">
                  The biggest thing I learned during this stage was that there
                  was a divide between older and younger employees due to ease
                  of use of the app.

                  By asking "How Might We" questions while listening back to my

                  addressed in the redesign. I jotted down notes and questions
                  related to changes, features and ideas that could potentially
                  be implemented.

                  I was able to research features of the two competitor
                  products. The first Synq Order Up, is used specifically for
                  expensive lockup items that require employee intervention to
                  purchase. Acuity Playbook is more similar to Beacons, except
                  it suggests paths for employees to take in order to
                  successfully sell product.

                  Analyzing applications competitive with Beacons was a
                  roadblock I faced, because most similar products require
                  consultation to get access. To overcome this, I researched
                  applications, like Square, that are have to take into account
                  the experience of both the employee and the customer.

                  I created a site map within the application to provide a birds
                  eye view of the entire system. This allowed me to recognize
                  that the landing page was not in an optimal location. The
                  biggest change I made to the mapping of the application was
                  changing the landing page to better suit the needs of
                  employees.

                  I was able to build realistic personas that were based off the
                  employees that I had interviewed. I created two personas that
                  represented the two types of users that I had to accommodate.
                  This persona consisted of the employees that were using the
                  application to complete a task.

                  prioritizing the escalated requests? I knew I could verify

                      The previous system of having a customer experience score
                      for the entire store was impersonal and did not do
                      anything to encourage employee success. By implementing a
                      personal badge and level system for retail employees, they
                      are able to see their progression separate from their
                      store success and their coworkers.

                  I started this project as a case study, to further my UI and
                  UX skills, but I was able to work with Dynamics and learn far
                  more than I had anticipated. I found this product so
                  interesting because it concerns the user journey of both the
                  user and the customer. My skills in prototyping, user testing
                  and iterating have vastly improved since working on this
                  project.
