                Beacons was created with the goal of enhancing the customer to
                employee service experience, not eliminating it. My goal was to
                expand the reach of the beacons app to more retail stores by
                creating a design that was more clearly emphasizes employee
                success, over retailer success alone.

                I started researching by interviewing employees at the Canadian
                Tire Kanata store to learn the application from their
                perspective. I did this to learn about pain points within the
                user journeys. For example, I learned that there was a divide
                between older and younger employees due to ease of use of the
                app. Some questions I asked were as such: What do you consider
                pros and cons? What was the previous system used to answer
                customer requests? Can you walk me through your regular use
                cases of the app?

                I started the designing process by asking "How Might We"
                questions while listening back to my interviews. I jotted down
                notes and questions related to changes, features and ideas that
                could potentially be implemented.

                Analyzing applications competitive with Beacons was a roadblock
                I faced, because most similar products require consultation to
                get access. I was able to research features of the two
                competitor products. The first Synq Order Up, is used
                specifically for expensive lockup items that require employee
                intervention to purchase. Acuity Playbook is more similar to
                Beacons, except it suggests paths for employees to take in order
                to successfully sell product.

                One of my goals during this redesign was to improve the user

                stories in the application to better understand them. The
                biggest change I made to the mapping of the application was
                changing the landing page to better suit the needs of employees.

                I began prototyping the main customer request user flow first,
                meaning how does an employee respond to a customer presses a
                button. I created two different iterations for completing this
                flow. The reason I did this was because I wasn't sure what would
                be valued more by the user. Prioritizing in progress requests or
                prioritizing the escalated requests? I knew I could verify this
                with A/B testing. There were also other UI differences between
                the iterations that I could also get user's thoughts and
                preferences. After A/B testing the customer request user flow, I
                was able to build the rest of the pages in the app around.

                I scheduled in-person user testing meeting with the same
                employees at Canadian Tire that I had previously interviewed to
                user test the user journey for creating a customer request. My
                user testing lasted about 20 mins, and consisted of me letting
                users find their way around the designed prototype and provide
                me with their thoughts.

                After user testing and iterating, I was able to use the feedback

                changes I made after user testing was the addition of an
                inprogress state for requests. This made it possible for
                employees to know, at a glance, who is already busy with a
                request. If they would like more information, like what specific
                SKU employees are busy with, users can visit the inprogress
                page.

                customer. My skills in prototyping, user testing and iterating
